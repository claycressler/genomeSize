This is the repository for Mueller et al. Metamorphosis imposes variable constraints on genome expansion.

To recreate the analysis:

1. Run get_consensus_from_jp_trees.R . The VertLife nexus file was obtained by downloading 1000 random trees from the VertLife website containing the 122 salamander species with genome size information. The full reference tree containing species for which there was molecular data from the Jetz and Pyron paper was obtained by downloading their data from Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.cc3n6j5).
